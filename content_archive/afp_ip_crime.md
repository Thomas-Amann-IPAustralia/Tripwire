Intellectual property crime

Intellectual property (IP) refers to something you create through your ideas or knowledge, such as a design, invention or artistic work.

IP rights allow you to legally protect your creation and make money from it. Enforcing IP rights is usually the IP owner’s responsibility as most IP infringement is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.

* learn about IP infringement, visit IP [Australia’s website](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip)
* learn about enforcing your IP rights, use IP Australia’s interactive tool, [IP First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/)

## Intellectual property crime

Intellectual property crime is a major problem across the world. We work with other agencies to combat it.

It's illegal to manufacture, sell or distribute counterfeit or pirated goods. Several laws cover IP crime, including:

* *Copyright Act 1968* (Cth) – making or using copyrighted material for commercial benefit is an offence
* *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* (Cth*)* – producing and distributing counterfeit medicines and medical devices is illegal
* *Trade Marks Act 1995* (Cth) – falsifying or removing a registered trademark is a crime.

In most cases, infringement of IP rights is dealt with in civil court because it's not a criminal matter.

However, counterfeiting is a crime under the *Trade Marks Act 1995* in some circumstances. Breaches of trademark law are dealt with by:

* the AFP
* the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
* state and territory police
* state and territory prosecution agencies.

Under the *Trade Marks Act 1995*, counterfeiting carries a penalty of up to 5 years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to A$115,500.

### Public safety

IP crime can have serious consequences.

For example, some counterfeit products, such as medicines, can cause [death or injury](https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/buying-health-products-online-has-risks/counterfeit-fake-medicines-and-medical-devices). Counterfeit personal protective equipment, like masks, can put health workers at serious risk.

Even if they aren't actively harmful, counterfeit medicines and medical devices, such as condoms, blood glucose strips or contact lenses, usually don't work. This means that people waste money for no benefit. Other counterfeit goods, like electronics, are also often faulty or dangerous.

### Links to serious crime

IP crime is a major global problem costing over US$200 billion each year.

Proceeds of IP crime are sometimes:

* used to fund [serious and organised crime](/crimes/serious-and-organised-crime "Serious and organised crime")
* subject to [money laundering and financial crime](/crimes/money-laundering-and-financial-crime "Money laundering and financial crime").

It can also have links to:

* [espionage and foreign interference](/crimes/espionage-and-foreign-interference "Espionage and foreign interference")
* [cybercrime](/crimes/cybercrime "Cybercrime").

According to Europol, trade in counterfeit goods represents about [2.5% of global trade.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas-and-statistics/crime-areas/intellectual-property-crime)

## Our role

We only investigate criminal matters related to IP. Our role is to enforce the penalties under the laws that cover IP crime.

We combat IP crime by partnering with:

* industry
* state and territory policing services
* Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
* Australian Border Force
* IP Australia.

We focus on taking decisive action against organisers, major importers and wholesalers of counterfeit goods.
