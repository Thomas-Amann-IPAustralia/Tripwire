# Domain Name Dispute Resolution

Make sure to use our **[updated UBS Switzerland banking details](https://www.wipo.int/web/news/w/2025/change-to-our-bank-details-please-update-your-records)** for all future transactions.

When your brand is misused to deceive consumers online (also known as “cybersquatting”), WIPO – the global leader in domain name dispute resolution – can help you reclaim the infringing domain name using an online enforcement tool called the UDRP or a national “ccTLD” variant.

[How do I know if I should use the UDRP or a ccTLD policy?](#accordion__collapse__03)

The [UDRP](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2024-02-21-en) applies to all domain names in gTLDs (e.g., .COM, .NET, and .ORG) including new gTLDs (e.g., .APP, .SITE, .在线)

**Many ccTLDs have also adopted the UDRP**, and these disputes can be combined with a gTLD case if the registrant is the same:   
.AG, .AI, .AS, .BM, .BS, .BZ, .CC, .CD, .CO, .CV, .CY, .DJ, .EC, .FJ, .FM, .GA, .GD, .GT, .KI, .LA, .LC, .MD, .ME, .MG, .MW, .NR, .NU, .PA, .PK, .PN, .PR, .PW, .RO, .SC, .SL, .SN, .SO, .TJ, .TT, .TV, .UG, .VE, .VG, and .WS

**Some ccTLDs have adopted a variation of the UDRP**, and these cases must be filed using specific ccTLD policy:   
.AC, .AD, .AE (and امارات.), .AO, .AU, .BH (and البحرين.), .BO, .BR, .CH, .CN (and .中国), .CR, .DO, .EU (and .ею and .ευ), .ES, .FR, .GE, .HN, .HT, .IE, .IO, .IR, .LI, .LV, .MA, .MP, .MX, .NL, .PE, .PH, .PL, .PM, .PY, .QA (and قطر.), .RE, .RW, .SA (and السعودية.), .SE, .SH, .TM, .TF, .TZ, .UA, .WF and .YT

For more information on ccTLDs that use WIPO’s case administration services and information on the specific local difference compared to the UDRP, visit WIPO’s page on [Domain Name Dispute Resolution Service for Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)](/amc/en/domains/cctld/)

You can file a UDRP or a ccTLD complaint by [email](mailto:domain.disputes@wipo.int) or using our [Online Form](https://www.wipo.int/domains/en/filing/complaint)

[How do I file or defend a case?](#accordion__collapse__02)

**The main steps to file a Complaint are:**

[1. Research the domain name registration details and the domain name status](#accordion__collapse__011)

> * Find out the Registrar for the domain name using [ICANN’s Registration Data Lookup Tool](https://lookup.icann.org/en)
> * Conduct a "WHOIS" search using [ICANN’s RDRS tool](https://rdrs.icann.org/) or on the Registrar’s website  
>   *For more information, visit our [Q&A: domain name WHOIS data and the UDRP](/amc/en/domains/gdpr/) webpage*
> * Check if the domain name has expired or will expire soon  
>   *For more information, visit our [Q&A: domain name expiry and the UDRP](/amc/en/domains/expiry.html) webpage*
> * Check the language of the registration agreement for a domain name  
>   *For more information, visit our [Q&A: language of proceedings and the UDRP](/amc/en/domains/lop/index.html) webpage*

[2. Review the UDRP, UDRP Rules, and WIPO Supplemental Rules](#accordion__collapse__022)

> * Consult the [UDRP](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2024-02-21-en), [UDRP Rules](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/udrp-rules-2024-02-21-en), and [WIPO Supplemental Rules](/amc/en/domains/supplemental/eudrp/newrules.html)
> * Consult the [WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Question, Third Edition](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/) which summarizes the consensus views of panelists who have decided UDRP cases on most major topics. WIPO also provides a [Legal Index of WIPO UDRP Panel Decisions](/amc/en/domains/search/legalindex/)
> * File size and format specifications for the Complaint are set out in WIPO Supplemental Rules
> * For “consolidated” complaints involving multiple domain names, complete the following [WIPO UDRP consolidation worksheet](/amc/en/docs/multipledomainnames.xlsx) to assist in the consideration of your request.   
>   *For more complete information on consolidation, consult [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [section 4.11](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item411)*

[3. Gather evidence to support your case](#accordion__collapse__033)

> * You must prove all three elements of the Policy: (1) that you have rights in your trademark [see [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [section 1](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item1)], (2) that the registrant has no rights in the domain name [see [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [section 2](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item2)], and (3) that the registrant has both registered **and** is using the domain name in bad faith [see [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [section 3](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item3)]
> * Ensure that you have the necessary rights to file the complaint, e.g., trademark registrations in the name of the Complainant (be sure to attach copies of your trademark registration certificates)
> * Be sure to provide evidence of bad faith registration **and** bad faith use (as applicable: attach screenshots of the offending website, fraudulent emails, prior correspondence with the registrant, etc.)

[4. Pay the filing fees](#accordion__collapse__044)

> * We can only begin processing your case when we have received the filing fee
> * Once a Complaint has been registered, our administrative fees are nonrefundable
> * A breakdown of the fees is available on the [WIPO Schedule of Fees](/amc/en/domains/fees/)

[5. Submit the Complaint to WIPO](#accordion__collapse__055)

> * Download a [Model Complaint](/amc/en/docs/complaint-lock-eudrp.docx) and submit it by [email](mailto:domain.disputes@wipo.int) or using this [Online Form](https://www.wipo.int/domains/en/filing/complaint)
> * Send a copy to the Registrar, whose information can be found on the [ICANN List of Accredited Registrars](https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars)
> * Complaints filed outside working hours or on holidays or weekends will be processed the next working day
> * You will get an acknowledgement of receipt once your case is registered, and the filing fee is received
> * By submitting a Complaint, the Complainant agrees to be bound to the [WIPO Data Privacy Notice](https://www.wipo.int/web/privacy-policy)

**The main steps to filing a Response are:**

[1. Identify yourself and let us know if you are represented by a lawyer [this is not a requirement; you can file a response yourself if you wish]](#accordion__collapse__066)

> * You may request an additional 4 calendar days to submit your response
> * You may also request an additional extension that may be granted in exceptional cases further to paragraph 5(e) of the Rules
> * If you wish for the case to be over without submitting a Response, and you consent to transfer the domain name to the Complainant, you should complete and submit a [Standard Settlement Form](/export/sites/www/amc/en/docs/settlement-lock-eudrp.doc)
> * For cases involving multiple disputed domain names, if you are not the registrant of all of the domain names, you should indicate which one(s) you are in control of   
>   *For more information, consult [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [section 4.11.2](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item411)*

[2. Review the UDRP, UDRP Rules, and WIPO Supplemental Rules](#accordion__collapse__077)

> * Consult the [UDRP](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2024-02-21-en), [UDRP Rules](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/udrp-rules-2024-02-21-en), and [WIPO Supplemental Rules](/amc/en/domains/supplemental/eudrp/newrules.html);
> * Consult [WIPO Overview 3.0](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/), [Section 3.11](/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/#item311) which summarizes the consensus views of panelists who have decided UDRP cases on most major topics. WIPO also provides a [Legal Index of WIPO UDRP Panel Decisions](/amc/en/domains/search/legalindex/)
> * File size and format specifications for the Response are set out in [WIPO Supplemental Rules](/amc/en/domains/supplemental/eudrp/newrules.html)

[3. Gather evidence to support your case](#accordion__collapse__088)

> * The burden of proof always remains on the Complainant
> * You only need to successfully rebut one of the three elements of the Complainant’s case. You may do this by showing (i) that you are using (or plan to use) the domain name for a bona fide offering of goods or services (you may wish to attach a screenshot of your website), (ii) that you are commonly known by the domain name (e.g., by providing evidence of your identity), or (iii) that you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name
> * You may also provide evidence that your domain name was registered in good faith before the complainant’s trademark rights existed
> * If you believe the Complaint is being brought in bad faith, you may ask the Panel to make a finding of “Reverse Domain Name Hijacking”

[4. Regarding payment](#accordion__collapse__099)

> * You are not required to make any payment if you agree with the Complainant’s single-member panel selection
> * If you ask for a three-member panel, you must pay half of the filing fees (typically USD 2,000) and provide a list of three co-panelists in order of your preference  
>   See [WIPO Domain Name Panelists List](/amc/en/domains/panel/panelists.html)
> * A breakdown of the fees is available on the [WIPO Schedule of Fees](/amc/en/domains/fees/)

[5. Submit the Response to WIPO](#accordion__collapse__0100)

> * Download a [Model Response](/amc/en/docs/response-lock-eudrp.docx) and submit it by [email](mailto:domain.disputes@wipo.int) or using this [Online Form](https://www.wipo.int/domains/en/filing/response)
> * Responses filed outside working hours or on holidays or weekends will be processed the next working day
> * You will get an acknowledgement of receipt once your response is received
> * By submitting a Response, the Respondent agrees to be bound to the [WIPO Data Privacy Notice](https://www.wipo.int/web/privacy-policy)

Questions concerning filing requirements and payments may be sent by email to [arbiter.mail@wipo.int](mailto:arbiter.mail@wipo.int)

[What are the fees?](#accordion__collapse__04)

The fee for your case varies depending on the number of domain names involved in the dispute and on whether you or the Respondent request a single member or a three-member panel

The domain name registrant (Respondent) is not required to pay any fees unless it requests a three-member panel

For a case involving between 1 and 5 domain names decided by a single Panelist is USD 1,500
