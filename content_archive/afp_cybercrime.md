About this crime type

## About this crime

In Australia, the term 'cybercrime' is used to describe:

* crimes directed at computers or other information communications technologies (ICTs), such as computer intrusions and denial of service attacks
* crimes where computers or ICTs are an integral part of an offence, such as online fraud.

It's a constantly changing frontier of law enforcement. Cybercrime has also become an important issue for the global community.

Technological advances mean cybercriminal groups can target thousands of Australians at once from anywhere in the world. They share tools, information and techniques through dark web forums and marketplaces.

Cybercrime is often linked to:

* [drug crime](/crimes/drug-crime "Drug crime")
* [fraud and corruption](/crimes/fraud-and-corruption "Fraud and corruption")
* [money laundering and financial crime](/crimes/money-laundering-and-financial-crime "Money laundering and financial crime")
* [serious and organised crime](/crimes/serious-and-organised-crime "Serious and organised crime").

Different forms of cybercrime include:

* malware, such as remote access trojans (RATs), keyloggers and ransomware, which inserts a file or code to infect, explore or steal information over a network
* phishing and spear (targeted) phishing, such as fake emails from a bank asking for login details
* man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters communications between 2 parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other
* SQL injection, a common web-hacking technique that adds malicious code to a database.

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) gives information on:

* types of [cybercrime threats](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats)
* basic ways to [protect yourself online](https://www.cyber.gov.au/learn-basics).

Combating cybercrime is a key part of our efforts to stay ahead of serious criminal threats to Australia and Australians.

We work to disrupt anonymous cybercriminals who are using the dark web to evade detection.

 Our work

## Our work

We investigate serious and organised cybercrime against:

* the Australian Government
* critical infrastructure and systems
* the Australian economy.

This involves working with other government bodies, including the:

* Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission
* Australian Cyber Security Centre
* Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
* Department of Home Affairs.

Most offenders use international internet service providers (ISPs). This means we also partner with international agencies, including:

* Five Eyes partners, an intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
* INTERPOL
* Europol.

Our forensics facility in Canberra has a digital forensics capability. This helps us catch cybercriminals.

### Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre

We lead the Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), which is based at a purpose-built facility in Sydney.

The JPC3 brings together all Australian policing jurisdictions. It ensures maximum impact on high-harm, high-volume cybercrime affecting the Australian community.

Its role is to:

* enhance intelligence-sharing and target development across police and industry
* coordinate joint task forces to counter priority cybercrime threats
* coordinate capability improvements through cross-skilling, joint training and collaborative tool development
* communicate prevention, awareness raising and media activities.

## Report a crime or concern

We can investigate Commonwealth crimes (sometimes called federal crimes) and crimes that take place in the Australian Capital Territory. What best describes the crime you want to report or what you want to tell us about?
