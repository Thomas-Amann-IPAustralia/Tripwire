### Party Category and Fee Calculation

Section 2.02 of the Regulation read in conjunction with the definitions in sections 1.03 and 1.04 sets out the basis of how fees are to be calculated. Fees for filing documents, setting down, for hearing, for mediation and for some services are calculated according to the type of body or person liable to pay them. A publicly listed company pays the highest rate of fees. A **corporation and a public authority** pay the next highest rate. All others, including any individuals, small businesses or unincorporated not-for-profit association, pay the lowest rate.

So the Courts can assess the correct fee which applies, each party will need to complete a [Party Category Information Form](/gfl/forms/party-category-information).

**Note: in some cases, such as if you hold certain government concession cards or you can demonstrate financial hardship, you may be exempt from the payment of court fees or entitled to a reduced fee.**
