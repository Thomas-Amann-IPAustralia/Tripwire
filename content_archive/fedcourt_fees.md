# Court Fees

The [Federal Court and Federal Circuit and Family Court Regulations 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2023L00023) (the Regulations) sets [fees that are payable](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/fees) in proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia. They also set the fees for the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, other than proceedings under the *Family Law Act 1975*.

The Regulations also sets fees for the service and execution of process of the Courts and contain provisions in relation to the administration of fees: including [how fees are calculated](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/how-calculated), [who is liable to pay fees](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/who-must-pay), [proceedings which do not attract fees](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/when-not-payable), [exemptions](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/exemptions), when fees are payable, [deferrals](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/deferral), [what happens if fees are not paid](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/what-happens-if-not-paid) and [refunds](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/refunds).

The Regulations applies to any document filed or any service requested since 1 January 2013[[1]](#_ftn1). Some significant changes were made to the fee rates from 1 July 2018 by the [Court and Tribunal Legislation Amendment (Fees and Juror Remuneration) Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018L00819).

Information about fees payable in the Federal Circuit and Family Court after that date is available on the [Federal Circuit and Family Court's website](https://www.fcfcoa.gov.au/gfl/gfl-fees).

Fees for filing, setting down, hearing, mediation, taxation of bills of costs and other services (except filing fees for human rights applications) set out in the Regulations increase periodically under a formula to adjust for upwards movement in the All Groups Consumer Price Index.

No GST applies to Federal Court fees as a result of determinations made under section 81-5 *A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999*.

[See Fees Payable](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/fees)

**Note:** The Federal Court of Australia Regulations 2004 as in force before 1 January 2013 (the old Regulations) continue to apply to:

* a refund of a setting-down fee paid before 1 January 2013; and
* any fee for a service requested under the old Regulations before 1 January 2013.
