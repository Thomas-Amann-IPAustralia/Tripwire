**Key points:**

* If you choose a company as your business structure, you must register it on the Australian companies register, managed by ASIC.
* Before registering a company, you will need to have some building blocks in place.
* Company officeholders have ongoing legal obligations after the company is registered.

## Before registering a company

Before registering a company, you should decide if it is the right business structure for you:

[Sole trader? Partnership? Company? Trust?](/for-business-and-companies/business-basics/sole-trader-partnership-company-trust/ "Sole trader? Partnership? Company? Trust?")

Other business structures such as sole traders, partnerships and trusts **do not** need to register as a company.

The companies register and the business names register are separate. If you want to operate under a business name that is different to your company name, you will also need to [register a business name](/for-business-and-companies/business-names/register-a-business-name/ "Register a business name").

Business.gov.au has a ‘[Help me decide](https://business.gov.au/registrations/work-out-your-business-registrations)’ tool that can help you work out the registrations you need for different business structures.

## Building blocks you need to register a company

Expand allCollapse all

### Company name

You can choose a company name when registering your company. There are [rules about what name](/for-business-and-companies/companies/register-a-company/rules-for-acceptable-company-names/ "Rules for acceptable company names") you can have.

If you do not choose a name, the Australian Company Number (ACN)

An **Australian Company Number (ACN)** is a unique 9-digit number issued to a company once it is registered with ASIC under the *Corporations Act 2001*.

we give you when you register will be your company name, along with the legal status of the company. For example, your name could be ACN 123 456 789 Pty Ltd.

See more about [rules for company names](/for-business-and-companies/companies/register-a-company/rules-for-acceptable-company-names/ "Rules for acceptable company names").

#### Reserving a name

If you are not ready to register your company but want to make sure a name is available, you can apply to reserve it.

You can reserve a name for up to 2 months. If you need to extend this, you must reapply. We do not reserve names indefinitely.

If you want to reserve a name, lodge this form:

[Form 410 *Application for reservation of a name*](/regulatory-resources/forms/forms-folder/410-application-for-reservation-of-a-name/ "410 Application for reservation of a name")*.*

There is a fee to reserve a name. The current fee is $62.

### Company address

You must choose a state or territory to be registered in, even if you do business nationwide. You must also provide 2 addresses: a registered office address

A **registered office address** of a company is the address where official and legal documents can be sent.

and a principal place of business address

The **principal place of business address** is the main location of a business or a company. It must be a physical street address in Australia and cannot be a PO Box. It is listed on the [business names register](/glossary/business-names-register/ "business names register") for the business name or on the companies register for the company.

.

For more about company addresses, see:

[Company addresses](/for-business-and-companies/companies/company-building-blocks/company-addresses/ "Company names and addresses")

### Company rules or constitution

Every company must have rules for how it will be internally managed. Your company can:

* use replaceable rules

  The **replaceable rules** are a basic set of rules for company governance. These rules are in the *Corporations Act 2001*. Some companies can use the replaceable rules instead of a constitution.

  from the *Corporations Act 2001*
* have its own constitution

  A **constitution** is a contract between a company and its [members (shareholders)](/glossary/member-shareholder/ "members (shareholders)"), directors and secretary. It explains how the company will be internally governed.
* use replaceable rules for some things and a constitution for others.

For information about these options, see:

[Company rules and constitutions](/for-business-and-companies/companies/company-building-blocks/company-rules-and-constitutions/ "Company rules and constitutions")

### Share structure and shareholders

You must provide your company’s share structure

The **share structure** of a company is the way share ownership is divided among shareholders. There can be different types and classes of shares, with each type and class having different rights and obligations.

and the number and type of shares issued.

For a proprietary company, you must provide the name and home address of each member (shareholder)

A **member** is also known as a shareholder. This is someone who holds shares in a company. These shares represent units of ownership in the company. A member can be an individual or an entity, such as a company.

. If the company has more than 20 members, you only need to provide details for the top 20 members in each class of shares. People will be able to see shareholder details for proprietary companies online on the companies register.

You must also get written consent from all proposed members, confirming the number and class of shares to be owned and amount to be paid. Here is an example of a [member consent template](https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4089647/consent-to-act-as-a-member.pdf).

For more information, see:

[Company shares and shareholders](/for-business-and-companies/companies/company-building-blocks/company-shares-and-shareholders/ "Company shares and shareholders")

### Officeholders (directors and secretaries)

For each proposed officeholder

We use ‘**company officeholder**’ to mean a director or secretary of a company.

A company officeholder is an [officer](/glossary/officer/ "officers") of a company, but not all officers are officeholders. The term officer is defined in the *Corporations Act 2001* but officeholder is not.

of your company, you must provide:

* their name (including any former names)
* their home address
* their place and date of birth.

People will be able to see these details online on the companies register.

If a proposed officeholder is worried about their safety, they can ask us to [hide their residential address](/for-business-and-companies/companies/register-a-company/hide-a-residential-address-on-the-companies-register/ "Hide a residential address on the companies register") from the public. Read this page **before** you register, and do not register using the BRS process outlined below.

Directors must apply for a director ID before a company is registered:

[Director identification number: Australian Business Registry Services](https://www.abrs.gov.au/director-identification-number)

A company must obtain and keep your written and signed consent before you become a company director or secretary. Here is an example of an [officeholder consent template](https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4089646/consent-to-act-as-a-company-officeholder.pdf).

## Fees for registering a company

There is a fee to register a company. For most companies, the current fee is $503 or $611, depending on the type of company.

See [fees for all company types](/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/all-fees/ "All fees").

## Registering with the Business Registration Service

You can use the Business Registration Service (BRS) to register a company. ASIC then processes the registration.

[Register your company with the BRS](https://register.business.gov.au/)

There are a few situations in which you cannot use the BRS. These are explained at the bottom of this page.

## Confirmation of registration

Once the company is registered, it will appear on the companies register.

If you used the Business Registration Service, the BRS will send a confirmation email to the address that you provided when you registered. The confirmation email includes:

* the company’s ACN
* a certificate of registration.

We’ll send the corporate key to the company’s registered office address. You will need it to use our [company officeholder portal](/online-services/asic-portals/company-officeholder-portal-access/ "Company officeholders").

## After registering a company

### Using your company or business name

You must display the company name wherever the company does business and is open to the public.

You must also include the company name and ACN on certain company documents. See more about [displaying your ACN](/for-business-and-companies/companies/register-a-company/australian-company-number-acn/ "Australian Company Number (ACN)").

If you want to do business under a name that is different to your company name, you will need apply to ASIC to register a business name. For example, the company ‘Oranges Fruit Store Pty Ltd’ might register the business name ‘Oranges Fruit Store’.
