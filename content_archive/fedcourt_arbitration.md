# Arbitration & International Arbitration

### What is Arbitration?

Arbitration is generally described as an efficient, impartial, enforceable and method by which to resolve commercial disputes.

### International Commercial Arbitration

The Federal Court has extensive jurisdiction under the *International Arbitration Act 1974*
(Cth) and Div 28.5 of the Rules. Commercial Arbitration
is a Sub-area of the Commercial and Corporations National Practice Area
(NPA).

There is a dedicated group of [Judges](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/law-and-practice/national-practice-areas/commercial/judges) with special expertise in international commercial arbitration who are allocated international commercial arbitration matters

For further guidance on International Commercial Arbitration in the Federal Court, refer to the:

* [Commercial Arbitration Practice Note (CA-1)](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/law-and-practice/practice-documents/practice-notes/ca-1)
* [Commercial Arbitration Sub-area](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/law-and-practice/national-practice-areas/commercial/arbitration) webpage

## Feedback

Any participant in a Court ADR process is welcome
to provide feedback on their experience, whether it be positive or
negative. This can be done in person, over the telephone, in writing or [electronically](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/contact).

## Interpreters

If you need an
interpreter to understand what is being said at a mediation or
arbitration, you will need to arrange for any interpreter that you
require.

If you cannot afford to pay for an interpreter, the
Court may be able to arrange an interpreter for you. If you want the
Court to arrange an interpreter you should contact the Registry as soon
as you are aware of the mediation date. If you do not, the Registry may
not be able to arrange an interpreter in time.

You can also call **131 450** and speak to the registry through a telephone interpreter.
