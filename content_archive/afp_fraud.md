About this crime type

## About this crime

Fraud and corruption are serious and complex crimes that need specialised skills and many resources to detect and prosecute.

We're responsible for investigating serious or complex fraud and corruption against the Australian Government. This includes:

* electoral fraud
* tax evasion
* welfare fraud
* identity crime
* corruption by government officials.

We work with other government agencies in Australia and overseas to stamp out [foreign bribery and grand corruption](/crimes/fraud-and-corruption/foreign-bribery-and-grand-corruption "Foreign bribery and grand corruption").

We don't, in general, investigate fraud and corruption in the private or not-for-profit sectors unless they also affect the Australian Government.

We also take action against organisers, major importers and wholesalers of fake products that infringe intellectual property laws.

 Our work

## Our work

Our fraud and corruption business area responds to:

* serious or complex fraud against the Australian Government
* corruption by Australian Government employees
* foreign bribery
* intellectual property crime
* complex identity crime.

We are part of a range of multi-agency taskforces that combat fraud and corruption.

## Taskforce Integrity

We work with Services Australia to investigate serious fraud and [identity crime](/node/140) in Australia’s welfare system.

Our joint operation is known as [Taskforce Integrity](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/taskforce-integrity?context=1).

It focuses on criminal networks and individuals who steal identities to hijack payments. It also looks at people on welfare with large amounts of unexplained wealth.

The taskforce can recover debts by:

* stopping a person leaving the country through a departure prohibition order
* seizing and selling assets
* taking money through bank accounts, wages and tax refunds.

If the taskforces finds evidence of a crime, it refers the matter to the [Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions](https://www.cdpp.gov.au/).

## Fraud Fusion Taskforce

The Fraud Fusion Taskforce investigates fraud across government services, focusing on the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

Members include:

* the AFP
* the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA)
* Services Australia
* law enforcement agencies and regulators.

It allows us to share intelligence about and respond to welfare fraud, especially if committed by serious and organised crime bodies.

## Serious Financial Crime Taskforce

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) heads up the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, which focuses on:

* cybercrime that affects the tax and superannuation systems
* offshore tax evasion
* illegal [phoenix activity](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/the-fight-against-tax-crime/our-focus/illegal-phoenix-activity/#:~:text=Media%20releases-,About%20illegal%20phoenix%20activity,business%20activities%20without%20the%20debt.).

The AFP sits on the taskforce, along with:

* ACIC
* the Attorney-General's Department
* AUSTRAC
* ASIC
* the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
* the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, which includes the Australian Border Force
* Services Australia.

## National Anti-Corruption Commission

The *National Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2022* (Cth) established the [National Anti-Corruption Commission](https://www.nacc.gov.au/) (NACC).

This independent agency detects, investigates and reports on serious or systemic corrupt conduct in the Australian Government public sector, including the Australian Parliament.

When requested, we provide specialist capability assistance to support the NACC’s investigations.

## International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre

We are a member of the [International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre](/crimes/fraud-and-corruption/foreign-bribery-and-grand-corruption#iacc "Foreign bribery and grand corruption"), which provides coordinated support for global law enforcement agencies to investigate grand corruption offences such as:

* bribery of public officials
* embezzlement
* abuse of function
* laundering of the proceeds of crime.
